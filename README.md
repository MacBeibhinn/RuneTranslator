# RuneTranslatorHTML

Runic Translator is a simple HTML file that allows anyone to translate English to any rune alphabet/script that is supported, or to build and edit their own. Feel free to change the English letters to letters of your choosing, or the runes to rune letters of your choosing.

**HELP:**

- To edit the HTML file you can use any text editor or code editor application, on Android, Linux, Windows, IOS, etc.
- See the comments in the HTML file on what parts to edit, what they do, etc.
- You can use Chrome or any other HTML viewer application or browser to launch the file and start translating.
- Set the file as a bookmark on your browser to quickly access your translator again.
- If you mess up the file when trying to edit it just download it again.
- You can add more runic alphabets by copying one already supported, for example copy and paste all "Elder Futhark" parts but change the ID and rename it.
- Will be updated regularly if needed so keep the link handy incase you ever forget where to look (https://bio.link/norse).
- You can remove the Valhalla+ links if you wish, if you are using the translator for anything other than personal-use then leaving the links are appreciated but still not required.
